    "> CNN >> Convolutional Neural Network \n",
    "* Image Processing , Image classification uses CNN.\n",
    "* It is specially designed for image classification and image processing.\n",
    "* Came after ANN applicable to images specifically.\n",
    "> How image is generated ?\n",
    "* Image is a collection of pixels.\n",
    "* Pixel is a grid like structure.\n",
    "* Resolution is a count of pixels.\n",
    "* Pixel has a concept at backend it is known as take any three primary colors (Red, Green, Blue) change their color intensity (Brightness intensity) by doing this we can form any color.\n",
    "> Color image is in the format of RGB format(RGB scale)\n",
    "* It has 3 primary color(Red, Green, Blue)\n",
    "* Range is 0 to 255.\n",
    "* If we take 0 it means 0 Brightness(Black color)(Red = 0, Green = 0 , Blue = 0)\n",
    "* If we take 255 it means full brightness (White color) (Red = 255 , Green = 255 , Blue = 255)\n",
    "* RGB scale is used to form color images.\n",
    "> Gray scale (Black and white image)\n",
    "* Primary color is Black.\n",
    "* Range is 0 to 255.\n",
    "* If we take 0 it means No Brightness (Black color) (Black = 0)\n",
    "* If we take 255 it means Full Brightness (White color) (Black = 255)\n",
    "* In between the range 0 to 255 we can take Gray color.\n",
    "> Color depth / dept of color \n",
    "* How many primary colors are used to form any image.\n",
    "* Color image >> RGB scale   >> 3 primary colors\n",
    "* So color deoth is 3 \n",
    "* Black and white Images?\n",
    "* Gray Scale >> 1 primary colors \n",
    "* So color depth is 1.\n",
    "> If we want to represent a color image (3 * 3) in which we have 3 * 3 pixels we will show it as \n",
    "1. 3 * 3 * 3 \n",
    "2. 3 * 3 * RGB\n",
    "> If we want to represent a black and white image (3 * 3) in which we have 3 * 3 pixels we will show it as\n",
    "1. 3 * 3 * 1\n",
    "2. 3 * 3 \n",
    "> In Image data each individual pixel is considered as individual feature.\n",
    "* Suppose we have a black and white image (3 * 3 * 1) so no of features is 9.\n",
    "* Suppose we have a color image (3 * 3 * 3) so no of features is 27.\n",
    "> Why we cannot use ANN over image data directly?\n",
    "* Example of Laptop screen (15 inch) >> resolution >> 1366 * 768 * 3  >> More than 30 lakh features , too much complex data.\n",
    "* In MAchine learning after a particular amount of data our models performance becomes stagnant.\n",
    "* In Deep learning after a particular amount of data more than Machine learning data it will perform better but after a particular amount of data its performance will also become stagnant.\n",
    "* CNN performs better than Deep Learning in case of more complex data so in case of image classification which is more complex data we can use CNN and not ANN.\n",
    "* In case of image classification in CNN we use ANN in Backend. But before that we need to convert the data suitable more for ANN that is we will reduce the complexity of the data first and then give it to ANN.\n",
    "* CNN performs preprocessing and then it will give data to the ANN.\n",
    "* CNN works like feature selection techniques.\n",
    "* It will select the best features and also it will reduce the complexity of the data and curse of dimensionality.\n",
    "> How CNN works ?\n",
    "* In CNN we add 2 additional layers \n",
    "> 1st layer Convolutional layer.\n",
    "* It is used to extract features from the images.\n",
    "> How convolutional layer works ?\n",
    "* Suppose we have 4 * 4 * 1 (Black and white image) original image.\n",
    "* Suppose we have 3 * 3 filter.\n",
    "* We can apply filter on the original image to create as many different filter images.These filter images are different from each other.\n",
    "* We can apply multiplication logic or division logic on these filter images to create the resultant output.\n",
    "* Suppose we have 2 images and we apply 5 filters each on these images then we will get 10 images as the output.\n",
    "* If our filter is 3 * 3 matrix and our original image is 4 * 4 matrix . In order to convert the filter matrix to 4 * 4 matrix we need to perform Zero padding (Adding Zero to the Blank matrix)\n",
    "* Applying filters to the original data image creates variation of the original image so that when we train our model we can have different varaiation of image to feed the model.More the variations more will be our learning of the model and the accuarcy of the model will get increased.\n",
    "> Rules of filter \n",
    "* We need to select the filter matrix as odd number to avoid overlapping.(3*3 , 5*5 , 7*7 , 9*9)\n",
    "* Filter image matrix depeends upon the size of the original image.\n",
    "* If the size of the original image is bigger than the the size of the filter matrix will be bigger and if the size of the original image is smaller than the size of the filter matrix will be smaller.\n",
    "> Stride \n",
    "* By how many pixels filter gets moved from new features.\n",
    "* \n",
    "> 2nd layer pooling layer \n",
    "* It is used to reduce the size of the extracted features.\n",
    "* We have 3 types \n",
    "1. Max pooling (When image quality is bad)\n",
    "2. Average pooling (When image is quality is good)\n",
    "3. Sum pooling(we dont use this quite often)\n",
    "* So when we have a good quality image we use average pooling .So that we can bring some good quality pixel values in to consideration to build a robust model.\n",
    "* When we have a bad quality image then we use max pooling. So that we can build our model on good quality pixel values.\n",
    "> Flow of CNN \n",
    "1. Image data \n",
    "2. We will apply convolutional layer on image data.\n",
    "3. To Extract features\n",
    "4. Then we will apply pooling layer to reduce the size of the extracted features.\n",
    "5. Then we will flatten our data that is we are converting multidimensional array into one dimensional array.\n",
    "6. Then we will apply fully connected layer(ANN)\n",
    "7. At the end we will get classification.\n",
    "* Convolutional layers works in sets (1 Convolutional layer and 1 pooling layer)\n",
    "> What do you mean by flattening of data in CNN?\n",
    "* We apply ANN in case of High complex structured data.\n",
    "* We are converting Multidimensional array into single dimensional array.\n",
    "* That is we are converting it into a structured data.\n",
    "> Data Augmentation \n",
    "* In data Augmentation we create different synthetic copies from original images by using some logic.\n",
    "* If we donot have enough data to train our model then we use data augmentaion to increase our data.\n",
    "* We can create a robust model by using a data augmentation."
