    "# Main Objective Of Deep Learning\n",
    "* To build an AI system capable enough to predict and to take decision on behalf of Human being.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Disadvantage of Machine Learning \n",
    "* We are able to build model only on structured data in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Deep learning is applicable for Unstructured data.\n",
    "> Types of Unstructured data \n",
    "1. Text   > Recurrent Neural Network \n",
    "2. Images \n",
    "3. Audio\n",
    "4. Video\n",
    "\n",
    "> Text\n",
    "* Example if we have 200 to 300 sentences and suppose we have 10,000 words each word will act as Individual Features and because of which our dimensionality of dataset gets increased (In Naive Bayes and SVM we can handle features upto 2000 and not beyond it will not work correctly)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Image \n",
    "* In Case of Image (Image is created by multiple pixels)\n",
    "* Resolution > Count of Pixels    >> Examples >> HD , Ultra HD\n",
    "* 14 inch Laptop >> Resolution >> 1920 * 1080 >> 20,73,500 Pixels on my laptop.\n",
    "* In Image data each pixel act as individual feature.\n",
    "* In such cases Machine learning models will not work correctly for such amount of features and becuase of which we use Deep Learning In Such Cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Performance graph betwenn ML and DL \n",
    "* DL can handle more complex data then ML and thats why DL came in use.\n",
    "* Ml is Suitable for simple data and DL is more suitable for complex data.\n",
    "* Complex data is that in the data we have curse of dimensionality (High Dimensional Data) and number of records is also High (Number of rows)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Use of Unstructured data \n",
    "1. Text data (NLP >> RNN , LSTM(Big brother of RNN)) >> In case of chatgpt we give text data input and the output we get from it is also in text format in its own language, >> Language Translation \n",
    "2. Image data (CNN,ANN) >> AI Image, >> lenskart (Choosing frames option)\n",
    "3. Audio data (Audio Analytics) >> Voice Cloning , >> Audio data of customers can be used by Industry to see if the customer is happy or not while talking to Customer Service.\n",
    "4. Video Analytics >> We know our universe is continuously expanding so to calculate the distance of the objects captured NASA uses Video Analytics to calculate distance between the objects, >> In terms of Crash test for safety ratings previously multiple crash test were done to calculate the safety of the car by use of video analytics we can reduce the number of crashes and instead study the safety of the car by a single video.\n",
    "* In Video Analytics we convert video to image \n",

    ">CPU (Central Processing Unit):\n",
    "* General-purpose processor for a wide range of tasks.\n",
    "* Few powerful cores optimized for sequential processing.\n",
    "* Suited for complex decision-making and control flow.\n",
    "\n",
    ">GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):\n",
    "* Originally designed for graphics rendering and parallel processing.\n",
    "* Many small, specialized cores for parallel tasks.\n",
    "* Suited for parallelizable tasks like graphics, machine learning, and simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Cardinality \n",
    "* If we have categorical data in target columns we need to do label encoding.\n",
    "* Label encoding is done when we have order in our categorical data.In case of label encoding if we have more values then the model can give higher weightage for maximum values.(We have 3 to 4 categorical data)\n",
    "* In One hot encoding we will get more features and there will be curse of Dimensionality which is not Good.\n",
    "* Having many categorical values in our features is called as Cardinality.\n",
    "* In such cases we use one technique by deciding the weight of the each category and the error associated with that category in the total feature, in this way we select only category which has high presence and low error.\n",
    "* cardinality affects vertically in the dataset (In terms of rows)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Curse of Dimensionality\n",
    "* Higher number of Independent features causes Curse of Dimensionality.\n",
    "* It affects the data Horizontally.\n"

    "* If we increase the number of neurons (Neuron is itself a algoritm) our complexity of the architecture(Neural Network) will increase and our Computation cost and time will increase and more resources will be Used.\n",
