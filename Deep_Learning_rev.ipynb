    "* But our noise will be less as compared to SDGA (Noise >> Smoothness of Curve)\n",
    "* In MBSGDA we learn from mini batch at a time hence we now have sufficient amount of learning to overcome local minima point , we ensure that we will reach to global minima.\n",

    "> Advantages of MBSGDA\n",
    "* Compared to BGDA , MBSGDA requires less resources and time to achieve convergence is less.\n",
